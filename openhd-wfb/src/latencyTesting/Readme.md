Here you can find the sources to build a simple "testing utility" 
that tracks packet loss and latency.\
It is not configured to run on OpenHD at the time but rather use a ubuntu pc with two (or more) wifi cards connected
& set into monitor mode. See the .sh scripts to loopUntilError wb from your pc.

If you do testing for a specific card or something similar, this is the place to store & share your results.
