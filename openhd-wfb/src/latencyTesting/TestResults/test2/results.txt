Aparently I was able to "catch a window" where RF noise is low. Here are a couple of runs,
these are "so far" the best results I got.

BW=20, MCS=7

BITRATE: 4.13711MB/s (33.0969MBit/s)
N of packets sent | rec | diff [60000 | 59998 | 2]
nReceivedPacketsWhereContentDoesntMatch 0
LostPacketsSeqNrDiffs 2,
------- Latency between (I<=>O) ------- 
min=528.327026us max=5.015000ms avg=1.436000ms N samples=59998

33MBit/s with pretty much zero packet loss and no packet delays.
So it is possible to get 33MBit/s with low latency if the rf interference is low.
I strongly think that rf interference is noticable in 2 ways:
a) packet loss
b) increased latency, probably created at the TX queuing packets



BITRATE: 4.68872MB/s (37.5098MBit/s)
N of packets sent | rec | diff [68000 | 67999 | 1]
nReceivedPacketsWhereContentDoesntMatch 0
LostPacketsSeqNrDiffs 
------- Latency between (I<=>O) ------- 
min=578.356995us max=5.108000ms avg=2.190000ms N samples=67999

Anything higher than 37 MBit/s and the latency increases greatly
