5.3.21
Used test environment 1:
Ubuntu pc with aircrag-ng driver
ASUS card as TX
Taobao card as RX

ez-wb tx setup as you can see from the script
simple test program:
sudo ./test -i 6100 -o 6000 -s 1446 -p 3000 -t 20

Conclusion from test environment 1:
22MBit/s seems to be the "sweet spot" here. 33MBit/s also "works", but latency increases

Now same as above, but done on rpi cm4 usb ports:
simple test program:
sudo ./test -i 6100 -o 6000 -s 1446 -p 2000 -t 20

since 33Mbit/s gave "almost issues" on ubuntu, here I am starting with the slower one:

(that's where all the lost packets "in the end" come from)

Once broken, it doesn't work again, as you can see here.

Plugging it out and back in, restarting tx and rx:

Okay, doesn't work again
